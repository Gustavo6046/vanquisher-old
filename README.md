# Vanquisher

This is a game about simulation, exploration and progression, meant to be
enjoyable, replayable and highly extensible; players wander on a terrain,
fighting enemies, acquiring inventory items, and exchanging loot with
themselves and the occasional markets and shops.

Vanquisher is also an on-going project to have a simple engine that
utilizes Python for the server and desktop client, and JavaScript for
object code and the [planned](TODO.md) web frontend, with persistent
worlds and multiplayer support.
